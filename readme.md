# Creating Bitmaps From Jetpack Composables

This app demonstrates how to create a bitmap from a Jetpack composable without the need to display the composable on the screen. Using composables to design the content of your bitmap is a better approach than using the older view layout system. Jetpack Compose does not provide the ability to generate bitmaps from a composable view but it can still be accomplished by using a standard view and embedding a ComposeView inside and then creating a bitmap from the compose view.
